## Introduction

Seas and oceans that are healthy are vital to human survival. We rely on them for food, energy, and water because they make up 70% of our world. Nevertheless, we have been able to severely degrade these priceless resources. We must safeguard them by stopping overfishing and pollution, and we must begin immediately to control and safeguard all marine life worldwide. Since the start of the industrial revolution, ocean acidification has increased by 26 percent, and an average of 13,000 pieces of plastic litter are found on every kilometer of ocean. Thirty percent of the world's fish stocks are overexploited, reaching below the level at which they can produce sustainable yields. This objective strives to manage marine and coastal ecosystems sustainably, safeguard them against pollution, and deal with the effects of ocean acidification. Another way to lessen some of the problems facing our seas is to improve conservation and the sustainable use of resources derived from the ocean.

## Objective
